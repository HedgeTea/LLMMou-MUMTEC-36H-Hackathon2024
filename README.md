### Project Overview
We tackle the problem by using a combination of LLMs for code optimization and a machine learning model for prediction

- **Problem Statement**:
- Firmware plays a crucial role in the functioning of hardware devices, providing the low-level
control required for operation. It also involves time and resources consuming processes. However,
traditional firmware development often faces challenges related to performance optimization,
resource management and adaptability to new hardware. Leveraging AI can revolutionise firmware
development by automating complex tasks and enhancing performance.
- **Proposed Solution**: 
- Claude Sonnet 3.5 for optimizing code
- Temporal Fusion Transformer model for predicting hardware failure
